Evernote Cloud API Thrift IDL files version 1.24
========================================================

This repository contains the Thrift interface definition files for the Evernote Cloud API. Most developers won't need these, but they can be helpful if you're generating your own Thrift code for some reason.

See http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/ for full Cloud API documentation.
